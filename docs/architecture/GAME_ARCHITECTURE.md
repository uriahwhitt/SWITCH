# SWITCH Game Architecture

## Overview
SWITCH is built on Unity 2022.3 LTS with a modular, event-driven architecture designed for mobile performance and endless gameplay.

## Core Systems

### Game Manager System
- **GameManager**: Central singleton managing game state and flow
- **GameState**: Enum-based state machine for game phases
- **EventSystem**: Centralized event handling for loose coupling

### Board Management System
- **BoardController**: Manages 8x8 grid and tile placement
- **TileManager**: Handles individual tile lifecycle and pooling
- **GridSystem**: Spatial grid calculations and validation

### Directional Gravity System
- **DirectionalGravity**: Revolutionary player-controlled gravity
- **FlowController**: Manages tile flow from edges
- **DirectionIndicator**: Visual feedback for gravity direction

### Queue System
- **QueueSystem**: 10-dot vertical queue management
- **QueueVisualizer**: UI representation of upcoming tiles
- **QueueAnimator**: Smooth drop and refill animations

### Matching System
- **MatchDetector**: Finds matches in current board state
- **CascadeResolver**: Handles chain reactions and cascades
- **ScoreCalculator**: Calculates points and multipliers

### Power-Up System
- **PowerUpManager**: Central power-up coordination
- **PowerUpBase**: Abstract base for all power-ups
- **PowerUpInventory**: Player's power-up collection

## Data Architecture

### Configuration System
- **GameConfig**: Core game settings and balance
- **TileConfig**: Tile types, colors, and properties
- **PowerUpConfig**: Power-up definitions and effects

### Persistent Data
- **PlayerProfile**: Player progress and statistics
- **GameSettings**: User preferences and accessibility
- **AchievementData**: Unlocked achievements and progress

### Runtime Data
- **BoardState**: Current grid state and tile positions
- **QueueState**: Current queue contents and flow
- **GameSession**: Current run statistics and state

## UI Architecture

### UI Management
- **UIManager**: Central UI coordination and state
- **HUDController**: Game HUD elements and updates
- **MenuSystem**: Menu navigation and transitions

### Input System
- **InputManager**: Touch and swipe input handling
- **GestureDetector**: Swipe direction recognition
- **InputValidator**: Input validation and feedback

## Service Layer

### External Services
- **AnalyticsService**: Game analytics and metrics
- **AdService**: Advertisement integration
- **LeaderboardService**: Online leaderboards
- **CloudSaveService**: Progress synchronization

### Local Services
- **AudioService**: Sound effects and music
- **LocalizationService**: Multi-language support
- **NotificationService**: Local notifications

## Performance Architecture

### Optimization Systems
- **ObjectPoolManager**: Centralized object pooling
- **TextureAtlasManager**: Sprite optimization
- **AudioPoolManager**: Audio source pooling

### Profiling Integration
- **PerformanceProfiler**: Runtime performance monitoring
- **MemoryTracker**: Memory usage tracking
- **FPSCounter**: Frame rate monitoring

## Security Architecture

### Anti-Cheat Systems
- **ScoreValidator**: Server-side score validation
- **StatisticsAnalyzer**: Anomaly detection
- **ReplaySystem**: Game replay for verification

### Data Protection
- **EncryptionService**: Sensitive data encryption
- **SecureStorage**: Secure local data storage
- **APISecurity**: Secure API communication

## Modular Design Principles

### Separation of Concerns
- Each system has a single responsibility
- Clear interfaces between systems
- Minimal dependencies between modules

### Event-Driven Communication
- Systems communicate through events
- Loose coupling enables easy testing
- Flexible system interactions

### Configuration-Driven Behavior
- Game behavior controlled by ScriptableObjects
- Easy balance adjustments without code changes
- A/B testing support through configuration

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless game logic for easy scaling
- Service-oriented architecture
- Microservices for backend components

### Performance Scaling
- Dynamic quality settings based on device
- LOD systems for complex effects
- Adaptive frame rate based on performance

### Feature Scaling
- Modular power-up system
- Pluggable game modes
- Extensible achievement system
