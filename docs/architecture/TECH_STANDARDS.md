# SWITCH Technical Standards

## Code Standards

### C# Coding Conventions
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// GameManager class demonstrates the singleton pattern for global state management.
/// Educational: This shows how to implement a singleton in Unity with proper lifecycle management.
/// Performance: Ensures only one instance exists, reducing memory overhead.
/// </summary>
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour

/// <summary>
/// Calculates the current score based on matches and multipliers.
/// Educational: This demonstrates score calculation with performance considerations.
/// Performance: Uses cached values to avoid repeated calculations.
/// </summary>
/// <returns>The calculated score value</returns>
public void CalculateScore()

// Field naming: camelCase with documentation
/// <summary>
/// Movement speed for tile animations. Configurable in Inspector.
/// Educational: This demonstrates Unity's SerializeField pattern for Inspector access.
/// </summary>
private float moveSpeed;

/// <summary>
/// Current game score. Read-only property with backing field.
/// Educational: This demonstrates the property pattern for data encapsulation.
/// </summary>
public int Score => score;

// Constant naming: UPPER_CASE with documentation
/// <summary>
/// Maximum number of tiles on the board. Used for performance optimization.
/// Educational: This shows how to use constants for magic number elimination.
/// </summary>
const int MAX_TILES = 64;

/// <summary>
/// Event fired when the player's score changes. Used for UI updates and analytics.
/// Educational: This demonstrates the observer pattern for loose coupling.
/// </summary>
public static event Action<int> OnScoreChanged;
```

### Unity-Specific Standards
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Tile prefab reference for object pooling. Set in Inspector.
/// Educational: This demonstrates Unity's prefab system and object pooling pattern.
/// Performance: Prefab references avoid runtime GameObject creation.
/// </summary>
[SerializeField] private GameObject tilePrefab;

/// <summary>
/// Score backing field with public read-only property.
/// Educational: This demonstrates Unity's SerializeField pattern with property encapsulation.
/// Performance: Direct field access avoids property call overhead.
/// </summary>
[SerializeField] private int score;
public int Score => score;

/// <summary>
/// Cached Rigidbody2D reference for performance optimization.
/// Educational: This demonstrates Unity's component caching pattern.
/// Performance: Avoids repeated GetComponent calls in Update loops.
/// </summary>
private Rigidbody2D rb;

/// <summary>
/// Unity lifecycle method for component initialization.
/// Educational: This demonstrates Unity's Awake() method and component caching.
/// Performance: Caching components in Awake() is more efficient than in Update().
/// </summary>
private void Awake()
{
    rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>(); // Cache component reference
}
```

### File Organization
- One class per file
- File name matches class name
- Namespace: `SWITCH.[Module]`
- Header comment with purpose and dependencies

### Performance Standards

- Memory allocation <1KB per frame
- Draw calls <100 total
- Load time <5 seconds
- No Find() methods in Update loops
- Object pooling for all repeated objects

## Architecture Standards

### Design Patterns
- **Singleton**: GameManager and service managers
- **Object Pool**: All tiles, effects, and UI elements
- **Observer**: Event system for loose coupling
- **Strategy**: Power-up system with pluggable behaviors
- **Factory**: Tile and power-up creation

### Dependency Management
- Constructor injection where possible
- Service locator for Unity components
- Interface-based dependencies
- Minimal circular dependencies

### Error Handling
- Try-catch for external service calls
- Validation for all public methods
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Testing Standards

### Unit Testing
- Test all public methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain >80% code coverage

### Integration Testing
- Test system interactions
- Validate data flow between components
- Test with realistic data sets
- Performance regression testing

### Play Mode Testing
- Test complete gameplay scenarios
- Validate user interactions
