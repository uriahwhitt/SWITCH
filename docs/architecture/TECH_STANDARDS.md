# SWITCH Technical Standards

## Code Standards

### C# Coding Conventions
```csharp
// Class naming: PascalCase
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour

// Method naming: PascalCase
public void CalculateScore()

// Field naming: camelCase
private float moveSpeed;

// Property naming: PascalCase
public int Score => score;

// Constant naming: UPPER_CASE
const int MAX_TILES = 64;

// Event naming: PascalCase with On prefix
public static event Action<int> OnScoreChanged;
```

### Unity-Specific Standards
```csharp
// Use [SerializeField] for private fields needing Inspector access
[SerializeField] private GameObject tilePrefab;

// Use properties with backing fields
[SerializeField] private int score;
public int Score => score;

// Cache component references in Awake/Start
private Rigidbody2D rb;
private void Awake()
{
    rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
}
```

### File Organization
- One class per file
- File name matches class name
- Namespace: `SWITCH.[Module]`
- Header comment with purpose and dependencies

### Performance Standards
- Maintain 60 FPS on target devices
- Memory allocation <1KB per frame
- Draw calls <100 total
- Load time <5 seconds
- No Find() methods in Update loops
- Object pooling for all repeated objects

## Architecture Standards

### Design Patterns
- **Singleton**: GameManager and service managers
- **Object Pool**: All tiles, effects, and UI elements
- **Observer**: Event system for loose coupling
- **Strategy**: Power-up system with pluggable behaviors
- **Factory**: Tile and power-up creation

### Dependency Management
- Constructor injection where possible
- Service locator for Unity components
- Interface-based dependencies
- Minimal circular dependencies

### Error Handling
- Try-catch for external service calls
- Validation for all public methods
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Testing Standards

### Unit Testing
- Test all public methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain >80% code coverage

### Integration Testing
- Test system interactions
- Validate data flow between components
- Test with realistic data sets
- Performance regression testing

### Play Mode Testing
- Test complete gameplay scenarios
- Validate user interactions
- Test on multiple devices
- Performance profiling integration

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- XML documentation for public APIs
- Inline comments for complex algorithms
- README files for each major system
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)

### UML Diagrams
- Class diagrams for system architecture
- Sequence diagrams for complex interactions
- State diagrams for game state machines
- Activity diagrams for algorithms

### API Documentation
- OpenAPI specifications for backend APIs
- Request/response examples
- Error code documentation
- Authentication requirements

## Security Standards

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting

### Anti-Cheat Measures
- Server-side score validation
- Statistical anomaly detection
- Replay system for verification
- Community reporting system

### Privacy Compliance
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- CCPA compliance for California users
- Data minimization principles
- User consent management

## Performance Standards

### Mobile Optimization
- 60 FPS target on iPhone 8 and equivalent Android
- 30 FPS minimum on older devices
- Battery usage <10% per hour
- Memory usage <200MB total

### Asset Optimization
- Texture atlasing for sprites
- Audio compression and streaming
- Model LOD for 3D elements
- Shader optimization

### Build Optimization
- Separate builds for iOS and Android
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Asset bundle optimization
- Code stripping for release builds

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Code Review Process
- All code must be reviewed before merge
- Automated testing must pass
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Documentation must be updated

### Release Standards
- No critical bugs in release
- Performance targets met
- All tests passing
- Documentation complete
- Security audit passed

### Monitoring Standards
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- User analytics and feedback
- A/B testing framework
