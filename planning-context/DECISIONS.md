# SWITCH Technical Decisions

## Decision Log

### 2025-01-XX - Technology Stack
**Decision**: Use Unity 2022.3 LTS for game development
**Rationale**: 
- Mature 2D game development tools
- Excellent mobile performance optimization
- Strong asset pipeline for puzzle games
- Extensive documentation and community
- LTS version ensures stability

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Unreal Engine (overkill for 2D puzzle game)
- Godot (smaller community, less mobile optimization)
- Custom framework (too much development overhead)

### 2025-01-XX - Architecture Pattern
**Decision**: Event-driven architecture with singleton GameManager
**Rationale**:
- Loose coupling between systems
- Easy to test and maintain
- Familiar pattern for team
- Good performance characteristics

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure component system (too complex for puzzle game)
- Hierarchical manager system (too rigid)

### 2025-01-XX - Performance Strategy
**Decision**: Object pooling for all repeated objects
**Rationale**:
- Critical for 60 FPS on mobile
- Reduces garbage collection
- Standard Unity optimization practice
- Required for endless gameplay

**Implementation**:
- Pool all tiles, effects, and UI elements
- Pre-allocate pools in Awake()
- Never destroy pooled objects in gameplay

### 2025-01-XX - Input System
**Decision**: Use Unity's new Input System with touch/swipe detection
**Rationale**:
- Modern Unity best practice
- Better mobile touch support
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Future-proof implementation

### 2025-01-XX - Backend Service
**Decision**: Firebase for backend services
**Rationale**:
- Fast MVP implementation
- Unity integration available
- Handles scaling automatically
- Good mobile optimization

**Services Included**:
- Authentication
- Realtime Database (leaderboards)
- Analytics
- Remote Config
- Push Notifications

### 2025-01-XX - Audio System
**Decision**: Use Unity AudioSource with compressed audio files
**Rationale**:
- Built-in Unity audio system
- Good compression options
- Easy to implement
- Sufficient for puzzle game needs

**Audio Requirements**:
- Sound effects for matches, power-ups, UI
- Background music (optional)
- Audio settings persistence

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Game Loop
**Decision**: Update-driven with event callbacks
```csharp
private void Update()
{
    // Check for input
    // Update game state
    // Trigger events for UI updates
}
```

### Data Persistence
**Decision**: JSON serialization with PlayerPrefs fallback
**Rationale**:
- Simple implementation
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Easy to debug and modify
- Sufficient for single-player data

### UI Framework
**Decision**: Unity UI (uGUI) with DOTween animations
**Rationale**:
- Built into Unity
- Good mobile performance
- DOTween provides smooth animations
- Familiar to team

## Performance Decisions

### Rendering Strategy
**Decision**: 2D sprite rendering with texture atlasing
**Rationale**:
- Best performance for 2D games
- Reduces draw calls
- Easy asset management
- Mobile optimized

### Memory Management
**Decision**: Aggressive object pooling and sprite atlasing
**Rationale**:
- Essential for mobile performance
- Reduces garbage collection
- Maintains 60 FPS target
- Required for endless gameplay

### Build Optimization
**Decision**: Separate builds for iOS and Android with platform-specific optimizations
**Rationale**:
- Platform-specific performance tuning
- Different asset compression
- Platform-specific features
- Better user experience

## Security Decisions

### Score Validation
**Decision**: Server-side validation with statistical analysis
**Rationale**:
- Prevents score cheating
- Maintains leaderboard integrity
- Encourages fair play
- Required for competitive features

### Data Protection
**Decision**: Secure API endpoints with HTTPS
**Rationale**:
- Protects user data
- Industry standard practice
- Required for app store approval
- Builds user trust

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Consider migration to AWS if Firebase limitations reached
- Implement horizontal scaling for multiplayer features
- Plan for international expansion with CDN

### Feature Extensibility
- Modular power-up system for easy expansion
- Event system supports new mechanics
- ScriptableObject configs enable design iteration

### Platform Expansion
- Consider console ports with different input methods
- Plan for Apple TV and Android TV versions
- Desktop version for development and testing
