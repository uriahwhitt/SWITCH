# SWITCH Sprint Status

## Current Sprint: Sprint 0 - Project Setup
**Week**: 0 of 0
**Day**: 1 of 1
**Overall Progress**: 100% ✅

## Today's Focus
- [x] Create complete directory structure
- [x] Set up planning-context directory
- [x] Create documentation structure
- [x] Prepare UML diagram folders
- [x] Set up Unity project structure
- [x] Create essential scripts

## Completed Tasks
### Sprint 0
- [x] Project setup and directory structure
- [x] Planning documentation files created
- [x] Planning context directory established
- [x] Unity 2022.3 LTS project configured
- [x] Package Manager setup with required packages
- [x] Initial scenes created (Main, Game, Menu)
- [x] Mobile build settings configured
- [x] Test framework setup and validation
- [x] Assembly definitions created
- [x] Build validation script created
- [x] Git repository updated

## Active Implementation
**Task**: Sprint 0 Complete - Ready for Sprint 1
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Blockers**: None

## Performance Metrics
- **FPS**: Target 60 FPS (not tested yet)
- **Memory**: Target <200MB (not tested yet)
- **Build Size**: Target <50MB (not tested yet)

## Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Smoke tests created (0% game logic)
- **Integration Tests**: Framework ready
- **Play Mode Tests**: Framework ready

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Using Unity 2022.3 LTS for development
2. Following object pooling pattern for performance
3. Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
4. Mobile-first design approach
5. Assembly definitions for modular development
6. Comprehensive test framework setup

## Blockers
None - Ready for Sprint 1

## Next Session Goals - Sprint 1: Core Mechanics
1. Implement directional gravity system with swap caching
2. Create extended 15-tile queue system (10 visible + 5 buffer)
3. Build smart tile distribution with anti-frustration
4. Implement basic match detection
5. Create endless survival mode
6. Develop basic UI and controls
7. Implement swap validation before gravity calculation

## Notes for Planning AI
- Unity project fully configured and ready
- All packages installed and validated
- Test framework operational
- Build validation script confirms setup
- Ready to begin Sprint 1: Core Mechanics implementation
