## Active Implementation
**Task**: Sprint 1 Complete - Ready for Sprint 2
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Blockers**: None

## Performance Metrics
- **FPS**: Target 60 FPS (not tested yet)
- **Memory**: Target <200MB (not tested yet)
- **Build Size**: Target <50MB (not tested yet)

## Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Smoke tests created (0% game logic)
- **Integration Tests**: Framework ready
- **Play Mode Tests**: Framework ready

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Using Unity 2022.3 LTS for development
2. Following object pooling pattern for performance
3. Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
4. Mobile-first design approach
5. Assembly definitions for modular development
6. Comprehensive test framework setup

## Blockers
None - Ready for Sprint 1

## Next Session Goals - Sprint 2: Polish & Power-ups
1. Implement power-up base architecture
2. Create 5 basic power-ups implementation
3. Build power-up inventory system
4. Implement power-up earning system
5. Create smart tile distribution algorithm
6. Implement anti-frustration system
7. Build cascade detection and resolution
8. Create shape accessibility system
9. Implement animation system
10. Add sound effects integration
11. Perform performance optimization

## Notes for Planning AI
